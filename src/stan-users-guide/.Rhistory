The `rep_vector(0, D)` call creates a column vector of size `D` with
all entries set to zero.  The derived matrix `beta` is then defined to
be the result of appending the vector `zeros` as a new column at the
end of `beta_raw`;  the vector `zeros` is defined as transformed
data so that it doesn't need to be constructed from scratch each time
it is used.
